  <h1>About Jeff</h1>

  <section class="content">
    <div class="wrapper b-about b-text-page">
      <p>Jeff Ross is a respected comedian, writer, director, and producer also known as “The Roastmaster General.”</p>

      <p>
        Jeff next Comedy Central Roast victim is none other than Bruce Willis. In the past he has roasted many infamous stars including
        Justin Bieber, Roseanne, Joan Rivers, Charlie Sheen, and of course The President of The United States Donald Trump.
      </p>

      <p>
        These roasts have become a mainstay in popular culture. In fact they have spread worldwide. His show “Jeff Ross Presents
        Roast Battle”, where two comics go mic to mic in a battle of wits has launched many careers and is judged by some of the
        best comedy minds of our generation including Jimmy Kimmel, Kevin Hart ,and Seth Rogen. Not only has Comedy Central made
        different versions of the show in Britain and South Africa, but now “Roast Battle” has taken it’s own life in comedy clubs
        all across the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jeff most recent comedy specials have him turning roasting into social commentary. With Jeff Ross Roasts Criminals, Jeff
        Ross Roasts Cops, and Jeff Ross Roasts The Border, Jeff has shed light on some of the more polarizing political issues of
        our time. He went to each of these places, immersed himself in their communities and then did a show for the people most
        affected by these issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jeff’s non-biased humor doesn’t stop there. He regularly goes on USO tours and performs for our troops stationed overseas
        as well. Most recently Jeff went to Iraq with The Chairman of the Joint Cheifs of Staff, Gen Joseph Dunford, and did holiday
        shows for the soldiers that needed it most.
      </p>

      <p>
        These days you can see him on his “Bumping Mics Tour” with his comedy brother Dave Attell. Jeff and Dave are headliners in
        their own right, but seeing them on stage together is a whole other beast that cannot be tamed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most recently Jeff has been lending his voice to many cartoons. With recent performances in Future Worm, Penn Zero: Part
        Time Hero, The Emoji Movie, and as series regular “Hook Foot” on the popular Disney show, “Tangled”.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Roastmaster General is a one man verbal assault unit that takes no prisoners, so what are you waiting for? Come to his
        shows and see if you have what it takes to get roasted by The Roastmaster General.
